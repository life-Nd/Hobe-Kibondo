ADOPTED !
I was abandoned after few days of my birth day.
thanks the to the Lord for the people who brought me into their house. Here is the little story of my life.
I had a wonderful childhood, my parents were loving and taking good care of me, but growing up i felt like something wasn’t right and i left it go.
As the time goes by the feeling grew, and one day my world crumbled.
Coming from school with some friends we were having kids talk and one of them said by the way you are not their child i looked at the kids saying you are lying but i saw in their eyes the conviction that it is the truth.
I rushed in the house crying and screaming, and my mom at the time she was home , she came rushing in my room , and i asked her “ mama is it true i am not your child?”
 And i saw in her eyes all the pain, all the brokenness , she went outside and called my dad who lives in France telling him that I knew i wasn’t their child.
She came to my room crying and she told me that indeed i wasn’t their child, that my mother left me at the hospital and i was taken to the orphanage that at that we were the first babies in the missionary of Charity Sister of Calcutta at that time in Burundi, there was a boy and a girl.
She tried to look for my mother but she couldn’t find her.
At that time i tried to process all the information that it was given to me. She kept on saying we wanted to tell you at 18 years.
Inside i was broken I know she was and still is.
As a parent myself, i understand , she wanted to keep it so that it won’t affect me in any way but she was robbed of that opportunity to tell me herself.
I am not even holding anything towards her , she raised me like her own, loved me like her own, given me more than enough and loves my daughters more than anything.
We tried together to look for my birth mother again but it was in vain.

 And from that day we started to go the orphanage with my mom, doing volunteering work( bring food, clothes, etc)
We did that till we left Burundi.
I took my daughter at the orphanagewhen the missionary charity sister of Calcutta had their 25 th birthday, all the kids especially the first kids we were there with our families.
You can imagine the joy in their faces seeing every children with their own children.
To adoptees: I always felt not good enough no matter what, self esteem hits hard, but imagine you were chosen from millions children to be in that family, you brought life and joy to them don’t listen to people who will say that you are not worthy of that family, YOU ARE WORTHY , you might even find your parents with time , with siblings.
Move on with your life, be successful, get a family of your own cherish them , be courageous life is worth living

To parents: I understand that sometimes it is hard to tell us that you adopted us, and you have your own reason( society)
There is no shame on telling us, it shows us that you have faith in us and you trust with the information you are giving us
To my Parents: I just want to thank you because you had a choice between the baby boy and me , yet it’s me you took to your house.
I am more than grateful for your sacrifices.
if i had to chose my parents its you a million times
To you mama : Thank you for the sacrifice that you made , thank you for the love , I know it wasn’t easy to leave me behind, just know that I respect you and I am really grateful for the opportunities you wanted me to have.
