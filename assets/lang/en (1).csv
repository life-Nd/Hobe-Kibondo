Today, as I stroll through the never-ending streets of Bujumbura, I see swarms of children living in the streets, often in groups. Some are as old as I was. I don't know what fate brought them there; in my day, street children didn't exist. Selfishly, I would have liked to have a little night companion to help me count the stars in the sky, so that I could forget for a moment a danger that could arise out of nowhere.",The discovery of truth,"One evening, awakened in the darkness of a night without stars by the steps of a neighboring lady, with an oil lamp in her hand to light up to the only communal toilet, I heard her audible whispers in Swahili (my neighbors in Bwiza were all Congolese): 'Humm, it is clear why she is abusing this poor child, it is because is not his!” I understood and learned that my mother was not my mother.","I don't know how she learned it, but the sky had just witnessed a sad and bitter revelation. Since that night, in the mind of the little child I was, everything has changed. Yet this lady with her kerosene lamp who felt sorry to see me there, neither she nor the other neighbors ever thought to take me into their house to lie on a small mat, just to warm my heart for one night, when I was the age of their children. Little by little, I realized that my misfortunes were those of another and did not touch anyone, even if compassion never helped anyone, even a small gesture...",The orphanage,"Around the age of 10, the social worker at Notre-Dame school and the only person I suspect of knowing my true story (the teacher related to my adoptive mother who still refuses to inform me for reasons I prefer not to) decided on my fate and decided to pluck me from my adoptive mother. They sent me to the orphanage with the approval of the authorities. I was sad to have to leave her despite the suffering she inflicted on me. I loved her, she was my mother, I only knew her.","Some women or mothers would look away from their children when we passed in groups, dressed in uniforms, recognizable in the distance because we were always forced to follow the same path that led us to Sunday Mass to secretly implore God to bring our parents back? Yet his paths remained impenetrable. These same women were spitting on the ground if not spitting on us saying 'ehe za mpfuvyi' as if we had chosen to be orphans!",A heavy name to wear,"As if that wasn't enough, Imelda gave me the name NZIKOBANYANKA (I know they hate me). The name was too heavy for an orphaned or abandoned child to bear. He has been a burden throughout my life, but today I have learned to bear it, to tame it. He came with me, and I accept him now.",Forgive to move forward,"All these horrors that I experienced are engraved in my childhood memory. I didn't forget anything, even age didn't erase those memories. However, I managed to forgive so that I could live in peace with myself and the world around me.",Looking for my origins,"To make a child, it is necessary to be two. Strangely enough, I've never felt a lack of a father. All my sad thoughts always brought me back to my mother. The child is always connected to his mother by the umbilical cord, and this bond never breaks!",A difficult choice,"I didn't want to suffer any more, I turned everything back. I didn't look for my biological parents for fear of being surprised. When I was ready to know my story, it was too late. All the people who could have informed me had already died. Fortunately for me, nature gave me a joie de vivre and a mental strength that allowed me, not to resign myself, but to accept my condition. Very early on, I took life lightly, for it was my destiny.",A message of hope,"Today, an accomplished adult, the experience of my childhood is behind me. The past has always helped me move forward and become the person I am. I chose not to have children, but I help others in my own way. Honesty, justice, tolerance and understanding of the other remain my core values.","No law in the world has the right to deprive a child of knowing his or her parents, regardless of the circumstances surrounding his or her birth. I also advise adopted, abandoned or placed children to seek their biological parents while there is still time. In my profession as a nurse, I often encounter adopted children who don't want to know their origins. I understand them, but it's a pity!",My message for orphans,"I never complain about my fate and I refuse mercy. I feel very fortunate compared to many children who grew up like me. As a nurse, I come into contact with human misery, moral and physical suffering. I did well and am proud of the person I have become. Thank you, life!","Alongside all these unfortunate experiences that thousands of abandoned children who are welcomed or adopted continue to endure, there are women and men with huge hearts who are only asking to share it with a small piece of innocent who has only one smile to offer.",A call to action,I thank Vinciane and her association for asking me to testify. I would also like to highlight the difficulty of their work in helping children to regain their origins and their parents.,"I could write whole pages and pages, but I limited myself so as not to tire the reader, as I have already mentioned. As the singer Jean-Jacques Goldman sang so well in his beautiful song: ""The world has its misfortunes, its pains that do not touch you, that do not touch me, that no longer touch them..."" May providence bless the action of Hobe Kibondo ""Heal the wounds of separation"".",Conclusion,"My testimony is just one story among many. It aims to raise awareness of the suffering of abandoned and orphaned children and to reiterate the importance of respect for the fundamental rights of all children, including the right to know their origins. I hope that my story will inspire people to adopt, support orphanages and associations that help children reunite with their families, and fight child neglect and abuse.",Never forget: every child deserves to be loved and protected.,Words of hope,Jean-Pierre Rukundo,THE HIDDEN CHILD,Par Jean-Pierre Rukundo,- 28 Mai 2024,My childhood filled with gaps,"My name is Jean-Pierre Rukundo. I was born in Burundi, East Africa, my mother gave birth to me out of wedlock at a young age, she was scared to raise me up as an unmarried mother and had to avoid any criticism that her and her entire family would face.","My father, also a person of influence in the community, was married and had a family and didn’t want to disclose my existence. My mother chose to have me live with her brother and keep me a secret.","I was moved to my grand parents at one year of age, and moved again at my uncle's place at the age of five who had had an accident during his military training. Due to that matter, he was paraplegic.","From the very young age of 10, with his guidance, I learned how to care for him. I became his caregiver while attending schools as well, yet I learned many things from him. Most importantly, I was taught that I needed to adjust to whatever situations that came my way and always create a positive outcome from unpleasant circumstances.",This was especially applicable to me as I was experiencing cultural stigmas of prejudice around my birth. People would say “he is an orphan” or “he is from the street” or “he came from the swamp”.,"Everybody knew that my uncle couldn’t physically have a biological child, everyone was confused, including myself. This stigma could be very difficult to live with. Knowing this, my uncle gave me positive pieces of advice and taught me skills which really helped.","That is how I decided to go against the thought patterns of prejudice. I did the opposite. I would not hold a grudge against those who were not kind to me. I stuck to the ideas of being resilient. My principle was “NEVER GIVE UP ON MYSELF""",DISCOVERING THE TRUTH,"At the age of 15, I visited my mom and her family for the first time. She lived 50 km from my uncle’s barracks in Bujumbura. I used to meet her once in a while when she came to Bujumbura for workshops or family gatherings. I knew that her kids were my siblings but surprisingly some of them didn’t know who I was (a cousin maybe?). However, they were so nice to me.","At the age of 24 I demanded my mom reveal all the unknowns regarding my birth. She confirmed who my dad was, my date and place of birth (the date I knew was wrong). Everything about me was a secret",After some short research I was then able to meet my dad and his family.,"Amazingly my new siblings were so nice to me. They welcomed me as if we had been in touch for a long time. We went together through a process of getting to know each other, it went smoothly which is unusual in our culture.","Finally, my siblings from both sides were able to deal with the stigmas surrounding my life. BRAVO! BRAVO!","Now I have my own family of 4, me and my wife were blessed with two kids who have numerous cousins, aunties and uncles who love them dearly. I thought that I was settled and clear about my identity. Alas, no.","Considering how I love my children, it’s hard to comprehend how a parent can ignore his /her child for so long. It didn’t make sense; I was basically abandoned by my own parents.","For that reason, I decided to help those who were born like me (meaning making). What I learned from this: society has a big impact on our lives (negative, or positive) that is why teaching understanding and forgiveness should be the key to a better life.",Jean Pierre RUKUNDO,Categories:,Family,Tags:,#parents adoptives,#famille,#adoption,By Caroline MUVIRA,- 13 March 2024,ADOPTED!,Introduction,"I was abandoned a few days after my birth. Thanks to God, great people welcomed me into their homes. This is the little story of my life.",Childhood and discovery,"I had a wonderful childhood, my parents were loving and caring. But as I grew up, I felt something was wrong, but I didn't pay attention.","Over time, this feeling grew stronger, and one day, my world collapsed. When we came home from school with friends, we were talking about our parents and one of them started: ""Anyway, you're not their child"". I called the other children liars, but in their eyes I saw the conviction that it was the truth.","I rushed home crying and screaming. My mother, who was at home at the time, joined me in my room. I asked her, 'Mama, am I not your child?'","And I saw in his eyes all the pain, all the tearing. She went out and called my father who lived in France to tell him that I knew I wasn't their child.","She came back to my room crying and let the truth escape, I was not their child, my biological mother had abandoned me to the hospital and I ended up in the orphanage of the Missionary Sisters of Charity of Kolkata in Burundi., I was the first baby of the mission to be adopted.",Consequences and reactions,"At that time, I tried to process all the information she was giving me. She kept telling me: ""We wanted to tell you when you were 18"", but for me that truth had been hidden from me and that's just what mattered.","Inside I was broken, but I know it was broken too.","Now that I am a parent myself, I understand. She wanted to protect me from fear that it would affect me, but she was denied the opportunity to tell me herself.","I don't blame him anymore, and I regret that I blamed him.","She raised me as her own daughter, loved me as her own daughter, gave me more than I needed and loves my daughters more than anything.","Together we tried to find my biological mother, but to no avail.",Associative engagement,"For several years, we went every Sunday to the orphanage with my mother, friends joined us, and in the end we were a good group to volunteer (play with babies, bring food, clothes, etc...). We continued until we left Burundi.","I took my daughter to the orphanage on the 25th anniversary of the Kajaga Orphanage. As the 1st adopted, I even gave a speech, a word of gratitude and encouragement.",I will never forget the joy on the sisters' faces when I see all these children they had entrusted to families come back years later with their own children.,Message to the adopted,"If the search for your blood family is not successful, grieve and live your life, succeed, start your own family, cherish it, be brave, life is worth living.",Message to adoptive parents,"I understand that it is sometimes difficult to tell us that you adopted us, and you have your reasons.","In my case, I would have liked to know, it would have been a proof of mutual trust.",Thank you,"To my parents: I just want to thank you, because you had the choice between the little boy and me, and it was me that you welcomed home and thank you for being a present and loving family.","I am more than grateful for your sacrifices. If I had to choose my parents, it would be you a million times.","To you, my biological mother: Thank you for the sacrifice you made, thank you for the gift of life. I know it wasn't easy to leave me behind, just know that I respect you and am truly grateful for the opportunities you gave me.","I always felt like I wasn't up to the task, no matter what I was doing, self-esteem was hit hard.",By Vinciane,- 18 March 2024,"When a mother can finally hold her baby in her arms, he is a few seconds old, mine I hugged him when he was 5 months old. Someone else had done it before me for maybe 1, 2, 3 days.",This seemingly short time span counts enormously in the life of any human being. Cutting the umbilical cord only breaks the physical link.,"My daughter and I sincerely believed that our relationship was evident until the day she learned this truth that I thought I would keep safe while she was young. She considered this silence a betrayal. Yes, I adopted it.","This 'secret' and all the mysteries around it broke her, I was just the foster mother, I lost my place, she rejected hers, she was looking for her landmarks, her heart was bleeding. This emotional wound was so deep that it resulted in relational trauma. For almost 20 years, she made me pay, I would have liked to have taken everything on me, but she also hurt herself a lot. One day of low morale, my sister asked me a question that made me think: “...and if she had been born lame, would you have asked her to walk straight?” She was in terrible pain.","There is no worse torture for a mother than powerlessness in the face of her child's pain. Glory to God, time is the best cure, the arrival of her 2nd daughter closed the wound, she needed to identify with someone.","If a biological mother lives in uncertainty as she is less able to control her child a fortiori an adoptive mother! Regardless of the age at which the adoptive child learns his status, his immediate or a posteriori reaction is not foreseeable, each being a distinct personality.","HOBE KIBONDO was born from our history and from the desire to share that the relationship of adoptive filiation is full of pitfalls, but that it is worth living. The taboo must be lifted, biological parents must be sought, “roots” must be sought and, if they fail, they must grieve.",THE HIDDEN CHILD,A Fragmented Childhood,"My father, an influential person in the community, was married and would not disclose my existence. My mother chose to make me live with her brother and keep me a secret.","I was entrusted to my grandparents at the age of one and then at the age of five, I went to live with my uncle, who had an accident during his military training and had become paraplegic. From an early age, under his leadership, I learned to take care of him while going to school. He taught me a lot, especially to adapt to all situations and to draw a positive result from unpleasant circumstances.","Growing up, I faced cultural stigma and prejudice about my birth. People would say: ""he's an orphan"" or ""he's from the street"" or ""he's from the marsh"". Everyone knew that my uncle couldn't have a biological child, so there was confusion about where I came from, including me. My uncle gave me positive advice and taught me skills that helped me cope.","Determined to go against the thought patterns of prejudice, I decided not to blame those who were not kind to me. My principle was ""NEVER GIVE UP"".",Discover the Truth,"At the age of 15, I visited my mother and her family for the first time. She lived 50 kilometers from my uncle's barracks in Bujumbura.
